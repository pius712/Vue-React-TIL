# Hook 규칙

## Only Call Hooks at the Top Level

Hooks를 loop, conditions, nested functions 내부에서 호출하지 않아야 한다.  
대신에, 항상 Hooks는 React function의 top level에서 사용되어야 한다.  
이 룰을 따라야, Hooks가 컴포넌트의 매 rendering마다 같은 순서로 호출된다는 것을 보장할 수 있다.  
이것이 리액트가 여러개의 useState와 useEffect 호출사이에서, 정확히 Hooks의 상태를 보존할 수 있는 이유이다. 

### 설명

As long as the order of the Hook calls is the same between renders, React can associate some local state with each of them. But what happens if we put a Hook call (for example, the persistForm effect) inside a condition?
```js
// 🔴 We're breaking the first rule by using a Hook in a condition
if (name !== '') {
  useEffect(function persistForm() {
    localStorage.setItem('formData', name);
  });
}
```

The name !== '' condition is true on the first render, so we run this Hook. However, on the next render the user might clear the form, making the condition false. Now that we skip this Hook during rendering, the order of the Hook calls becomes different:

```js
useState('Mary')           // 1. Read the name state variable (argument is ignored)
// useEffect(persistForm)  // 🔴 This Hook was skipped!
useState('Poppins')        // 🔴 2 (but was 3). Fail to read the surname state variable
useEffect(updateTitle)     // 🔴 3 (but was 4). Fail to replace the effect
```

React wouldn’t know what to return for the second useState Hook call. React expected that the second Hook call in this component corresponds to the persistForm effect, just like during the previous render, but it doesn’t anymore. From that point, every next Hook call after the one we skipped would also shift by one, leading to bugs.

This is why Hooks must be called on the top level of our components. If we want to run an effect conditionally, we 
can put that condition inside our Hook:

```js
  useEffect(function persistForm() {
    // 👍 We're not breaking the first rule anymore
    if (name !== '') {
      localStorage.setItem('formData', name);
    }
  });
```

Note that you don’t need to worry about this problem if you use the provided lint rule. But now you also know why Hooks work this way, and which issues the rule is preventing.
