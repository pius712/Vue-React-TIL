# Introduction


In Part 1: Redux Overview and Concepts, we looked at how Redux can help us build maintainable apps by giving us a single central place to put global app state. We also talked about core Redux concepts like dispatching action objects, using reducer functions that return new state values, and writing async logic using thunks. In Part 2: Redux App Structure, we saw how APIs like configureStore and createSlice from Redux Toolkit and Provider and useSelector from React-Redux work together to let us write Redux logic and interact with that logic from our React components.

Now that you have some idea of what these pieces are, it's time to put that knowledge into practice. We're going to build a small social media feed app, which will include a number of features that demonstrate some real-world use cases. This will help you understand how to use Redux in your own applications.

CAUTION
The example app is not meant as a complete production-ready project. The goal is to help you learn the Redux APIs and typical usage patterns, and point you in the right direction using some limited examples. Also, some of the early pieces we build will be updated later on to show better ways to do things. Please read through the whole tutorial to see all the concepts in use.

#Project Setup
For this tutorial, we've created a pre-configured starter project that already has React and Redux set up, includes some default styling, and has a fake REST API that will allow us to write actual API requests in our app. You'll use this as the basis for writing the actual application code.

To get started, you can open and fork this CodeSandbox:
